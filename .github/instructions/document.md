## Algorithm Explanations (Beginner-Friendly)

### 1. Most Frequent Item (Hash Map)

**Purpose:** Find the item that appears most often in a list.
**How:** Use a hash map (object) to count occurrences, track the max.
**Why:** Fast lookups and updates (O(1) per item).
**Example Interview Q:** "Given a list of machine models sold, which was sold the most?"

```js
function mostFrequentString(arr) {
  const freq = {};
  let maxCount = 0;
  let result = '';
  for (const str of arr) {
    freq[str] = (freq[str] || 0) + 1;
    if (freq[str] > maxCount) {
      maxCount = freq[str];
      result = str;
    }
  }
  return result;
}
```

### 2. Two Sum (Hash Map Lookup)

**Purpose:** Find two numbers in a list that add up to a target value.
**How:** Store each number’s index in a hash map; check if the needed number is already there.
**Why:** O(n) time vs O(n²) brute force.
**Example Interview Q:** "Given machine prices, can you find two that add up to a customer’s budget?"

```js
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const diff = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(diff)) {
      return [map.get(diff), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}
```

### 3. Group Anagrams (Bucket by Signature)

**Purpose:** Group words that are anagrams (same letters, different order).
**How:** Sort each word’s letters to get a signature; group by signature in a hash map.
**Why:** Fast grouping of similar structures.
**Example Interview Q:** "Given machine codes, group together codes that are anagrams."

```js
function groupAnagrams(strs) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (const word of strs) {
    const signature = word.split('').sort().join('');
    if (!map.has(signature)) map.set(signature, []);
    map.get(signature).push(word);
  }
  return Array.from(map.values());
}
```

## Performance & Efficiency Interview Questions

### React.js

- How do you prevent unnecessary re-renders in React?
  - Probe: Understanding of memoization (`React.memo`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`), atomic state management (Jotai), and component composition.
- What strategies do you use to optimize rendering large lists?
  - Probe: Use of virtualization libraries (e.g., `react-window`), key props, and chunked rendering.

### Next.js

- How does Next.js handle SSR and SSG? When would you use each?
  - Probe: Knowledge of SSR for dynamic data, SSG for static content, and hybrid approaches.
- What are the benefits of using the App Router and React Server Components for performance?
  - Probe: Understanding of reduced client bundle size, streaming, and progressive hydration.

### Drizzle ORM & PostgreSQL

- How do you design efficient queries in Drizzle ORM and PostgreSQL?
  - Probe: Use of indexes, query optimization, avoiding N+1 queries, and leveraging Drizzle’s type safety.
- What are common performance bottlenecks in relational databases, and how do you address them?
  - Probe: Indexing, query planning, connection pooling, and caching strategies.

### Caching

- What caching strategies would you use for real-time data in a marketplace app?
  - Probe: Use of client-side caching (React Query, SWR), server-side caching (Redis, CDN), and cache invalidation.
- How do you handle cache invalidation when data changes frequently?
  - Probe: Stale-while-revalidate, time-based expiration, event-driven invalidation.

### General Full-Stack

- How do you measure and monitor performance in a production app?
  - Probe: Use of Core Web Vitals, logging, APM tools, and real user monitoring.
- What trade-offs do you consider when choosing between client-side and server-side data fetching?
  - Probe: Latency, SEO, user experience, and scalability.

#### Example Interview Questions
