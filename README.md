# Document how to run the code (on the README)

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Project Overview

This is a full-stack bidding system built with Next.js 15, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS. The application allows users to view collections, place bids, and manage bidding activities through a clean, responsive interface.

### Key Features

- Collections management with CRUD operations
- Bidding system with real-time status updates
- User authentication (mockable)
- Responsive design with Shadcn UI components
- TypeScript for type safety
- JSON-based data storage (easily replaceable with a database)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

## Application Architecture & Engineering Questions

### 1. How would you monitor the application to ensure it is running smoothly?

**Current Implementation:**

- Basic error handling in API routes with try-catch blocks
- TypeScript for compile-time error prevention
- ESLint and Prettier for code quality

**Production Monitoring Strategy:**

**Application Performance Monitoring (APM):**

- TODOS

**Health Checks:**

```typescript
// /api/health endpoint
export async function GET() {
  return Response.json({
    status: 'healthy',
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    uptime: process.uptime(),
  });
}
```

**Logging Strategy:**

- TODOS

**Alerting:**

- TODOS

### 2. How would you address scalability and performance?

**Initial State around 3pm central Tuesday:**

- JSON file-based data storage (suitable for development/demo)
- Client-side rendering with some server-side components
- Basic component architecture

**Scalability Improvements:**

**Database & Backend:**

- **Migrate to PostgreSQL** with Prisma ORM for production
- **Database indexing** on frequently queried fields (collection_id, user_id, status)
- **Connection pooling** for database connections
- **Caching layer** with Redis for frequently accessed data

**API & Server Optimization:**

- **API rate limiting** to prevent abuse
- **Pagination** for large data sets (currently showing all collections)
- **GraphQL** or **tRPC** for efficient data fetching
- **Server-side caching** with Next.js built-in caching or Redis

**Frontend Performance:**

- **React Server Components** for initial page loads
- **Client-side caching** with TanStack Query (React Query)
- **Virtualization** for large lists using react-window
- **Code splitting** and lazy loading for components
- **Image optimization** with Next.js Image component

**Infrastructure:**

- **CDN** for static assets (Vercel Edge, CloudFront, Cloudinary, Sanity)
- **Load balancing** for multiple server instances
- **Database read replicas** for read-heavy operations
- **Microservices architecture** for complex business logic

**Real-time Features:**

- **WebSockets** or **Server-Sent Events** for real-time bid updates
- **Optimistic updates** for better UX
- **Background jobs** for processing bid notifications

### 3. Trade-offs and Future Improvements

**Time Constraints & Decisions Made as of 3pm central Tuesday:**

**Data Storage:**

- **Current**: JSON files for simplicity and quick setup
- **Trade-off**: No data persistence, no concurrent access handling
- **Future**: PostgreSQL with proper relationships and constraints

**Authentication:**

- **Current**: Mocked authentication (hard-coded user)
- **Trade-off**: No real security, session management
- **Future**: NextAuth.js with JWT tokens, role-based access control

**State Management:**

- **Current**: Local component state and prop drilling
- **Trade-off**: Difficult to maintain as app grows
- **Future**: Zustand, Jotai, or React Query for global state management

**UI/UX:**

- **Current**: Basic responsive design with Shadcn components
- **Trade-off**: Limited accessibility features, no animations
- **Future**: Full accessibility compliance, loading states, error boundaries

**Testing:**

- **Current**: No automated testing
- **Trade-off**: Higher risk of bugs, harder to refactor
- **Future**: Jest + React Testing Library for unit tests, Playwright for E2E

**Security:**

- **Current**: Basic input validation
- **Trade-off**: Vulnerable to XSS, CSRF, injection attacks
- **Future**: Comprehensive security middleware, input sanitization, CORS policies

**Performance:**

- **Current**: Basic Next.js optimizations
- **Trade-off**: No specific performance monitoring or optimization
- **Future**: Bundle analysis, performance budgets, lazy loading

**With More Time & Resources, I Would:**

1. **Implement proper database schema** with migrations and seeding
2. **Add comprehensive testing suite** (unit, integration, E2E)
3. **Implement real-time features** for live bidding
4. **Add proper authentication/authorization** with user roles
5. **Create admin dashboard** for system management
6. **Implement email notifications** for bid updates
7. **Add search and filtering** capabilities
8. **Implement audit logging** for all user actions
9. **Add data validation** with Zod or Yup
10. **Create comprehensive documentation** with OpenAPI/Swagger

**Current Architecture Strengths:**

- Fast development and deployment
- Type safety with TypeScript
- Modern React patterns
- Scalable folder structure
- Easy to understand and modify

This implementation prioritizes **speed of development** and **ease of understanding** while maintaining **good code structure** and **type safety**. The trade-offs made are appropriate for a coding challenge but would need to be addressed for a production application.
